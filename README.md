# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug: Unexpected $unwind Behavior

This repository demonstrates an unusual issue encountered when using the `$lookup`, `$unwind`, and `$group` stages together within a MongoDB aggregation pipeline.  The `$unwind` stage behaves unexpectedly, resulting in incorrect grouping of documents.

## Problem Description
The provided Javascript code snippet utilizes the aggregation pipeline to join two collections (`collectionA` and `collectionB`), then processes the results using `$unwind` and `$group`. The `$unwind` stage unexpectedly affects the subsequent `$group` operation, leading to incorrect data aggregation.  The intended outcome is that the `$group` operation would group all related documents correctly under `relatedDocs`, but this doesn't happen because of how `$unwind` modifies the document structure.

## Solution
The solution involves restructuring the aggregation pipeline to ensure the desired grouping behavior is achieved. This is often resolved by careful consideration of the document structure after the `$unwind` stage and possible use of `$project` to restructure the documents before the `$group` operation.
